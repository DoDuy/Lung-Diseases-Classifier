# Diseases Detection from Chest X-ray data
Machine Learning Capstone Project - Udacity MLND

## Project Overview
With so many lung diseases people can get, here is just one example of diseases we can save if we find them out earlier.
With the technology machine and computer power, the earlier identification of diseases, particularly lung disease, we can be helped to detect earlier and more accurately, which can save many many people as well as reduce the pressure on the system. The health system has not developed in time with the development of the population.

## Datasets
### [Sample dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample)
* File contents: this is a random sample (5%) of the full dataset:
 sample.zip: Contains 5,606 images with size 1024 x 1024
 sample_labels.csv: Class labels and patient data for the entire dataset
* Class descriptions: there are 15 classes (14 diseases, and one for "No findings") in the full dataset, but since this is drastically reduced version of the full dataset, some of the classes are sparse with the labeled as "No findings": Hernia - 13 images, Pneumonia - 62 images, Fibrosis - 84 images, Edema - 118 images, Emphysema - 127 images, Cardiomegaly - 141 images, Pleural_Thickening - 176 images, Consolidation - 226 images, Pneumothorax - 271 images, Mass - 284 images, Nodule - 313 images, Atelectasis - 508 images, Effusion - 644 images, Infiltration - 967 images, No Finding - 3044 images.
### [Full dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data)
* File contents:
 images_00x.zip: 12 files with 112,120 total images with size 1024 x 1024
 README_ChestXray.pdf: Original README file
 BBox_list_2017.csv: Bounding box coordinates. Note: Start at x,y, extend horizontally w pixels, and vertically h pixels
 Data_entry_2017.csv: Class labels and patient data for the entire dataset
* Class descriptions: there are 15 classes (14 diseases, and one for "No findings"). Images can be classified as "No findings" or one or more disease classes: Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pneumonia, Pleural_thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule Mass, Hernia.

## Metrics & Result
F-beta score with β = 0.5 to represent precision will be more important than recall in this case.
